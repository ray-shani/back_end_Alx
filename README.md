ALX Hub Access Management System

This project is a Django-based backend application that manages user access to the ALX Hub in Westlands. It replaces manual Google Sheets sign-ins with a secure system that categorizes users as Students, Alumni, Staff, or Community Members. The system allows administrators to track hub usage in real-time and ensure that only authorized people can access the space.

ðŸš€ Features

User Management (CRUD):

Create a new user profile

Read/view user details

Update existing user information

Role-based Categorization:

Users are identified as Student, Alumni, Staff, or Community Member.

Admin Panel:

Manage users via Djangoâ€™s built-in admin interface.

REST API:

Exposed endpoints for programmatic user management.

API Integration (Optional):

Fetch sample users/emails from external APIs for testing.
