The idea you decided to work on.
Within our ALX Hub here in Westlands(The Piano), we have been having an issue when signing in whenever you want to access the co-working. My idea comes in where, instead of a form a user signs in from a website, it shows whether the person using the space is either a Student, an alumnus, or a Staff member. 
This solves the problem of one dependency of Google Sheets and being able to also keep track of the students, staff, community members, and alumni accessing our hubs. This is also crucial to be able to know who might be coming to the hub, not being a student, an alumnus, or a community member.
This maximizes security on who is accessing the hub at what time and when they check out. This also ensures that whoever is using the space is a person within the ALX ecosystem.
What features your project will have?
My project will be able to fetch data about the following users ;
Student
Staff
Community member
Alumni
This will be able to distinguish users into various apps, with the users in each app, and how they can access the said hubs at that point.
The API you will be using(optional)
I will be using API’s from the following website (https://free-apis.github.io/#/categories/Email) to use as user examples and user emails.
The models you’ll need, API endpoints, e.t.c
The user profile model will be used to store the name, the email, and their status.

Your plan for doing the project? You have 5 weeks to complete it.
For the first week, I am in the Idea and planning phase, where I came up with the idea, made plans on how to implement the idea, asked if the idea makes sense, and refined the idea.
For the second week, I plan to work on the designs for my app and how it will work, generally asking for feedback as I go along.
For the third week, I will start implementing the final designs and how to make them work.
For the fourth week, I will still be building and wrapping up the designs.
For the fifth and final week, I will be making my final submissions and making a video explaining my application.
